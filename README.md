# Drawing with Fourier Transformations

This is a small project that I made for fun. It is pretty simple and can be used by anyone for any purpose.

## Description

The main.py file will run a pygame window where the program will draw a rabbit using circles.

The draw_and_redraw.py will run a version of the program that allows users to draw something that will later be redrawn by the program. First the window will be blank. By pressing the left mouse button and draging you can draw whatever you want. After finishing your drawing, you can press the space button to let the program redraw. Additionally, by pressing space again, you will return to the innitial drawing state of the program.
